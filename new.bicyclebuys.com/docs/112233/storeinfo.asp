	<p>
	We use the best known techniques to protect your personal information. If for any reason you do not want to send your credit card information over the internet, you can call in your credit card after you start your order online at <b>888 4 Bike Buy</b> or you can FAX <b>(1-631-673-2220)</b> the entire order by choosing the &quot;Print Order...&quot; option after you enter your shipping infomation at checkout time.

	<b>Purchase Agreement</b><br>
	</font>
	
	<font id="body">
	Bicyclebuys.com strongly recommends that the assembly of your new bicycle be performed by a reputable bicycle repair shop with knowledge of the manufacturer's specifications. As a purchaser of bicycle equipment, I assume the full responsibility of carefully assembling my bicycle according to the manufacturer's instructions and specifications, and always checking my bike and related equipment before a ride. I fully understand the hazards involved in the sport of cycling. As in all extreme sports, bodily injury is a possibility at any given time. 
	<p>
It is incumbent upon me to continuously check my equipment, especially the quick releases and brakes. All quick releases must be checked to make sure they are tight. Failure to do so might lead to failure on the ride. Proper tire inflation is important. Tires need to be checked for tears or worn tread. Allen bolts need to be tight. New bikes should be taken to a professional bike shop to be checked if not assembled by one. Proper lighting equipment and reflectors are very important for personal safety. They should be installed and in place on every ride. 
	<p>
By placing my order I explicitly agree to the provisions of the customer agreement and release Bicyclebuys.com from all liability whatsoever except for the shipment of the order I have placed. In no event shall the liability of Bicyclebuys.com be greater than the total amount of my purchase. Additionally, I understand and acknowledge that it is my responsibility to follow the manufacturer's instructions in connection with the assembly of the bicycle and to follow cycling safety guidelines and all local laws regarding cycling and cycling safety. It is recommended that you have a reputable bike shop with knowledge of the manufacturer's specifications perform the assembly. 
	<p>
Always wear your helmet and proper safety equipment. Bicycle riding can lead to serious accidents. Even with the proper use of safety gear, you could be seriously injured or killed. Bicycle racing, riding, and training can have the same risks as motorcycling, and you assume a large risk with similar speeds and hazards. Fully approved helmets are strongly recommended whenever riding.
