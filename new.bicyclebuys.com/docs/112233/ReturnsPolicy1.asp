      <p align="left"><font id="bodylgest">Purchase Agreement</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font id="bodylg">Bicyclebuys.com strongly recommends that the assembly of 
        your new bicycle be performed by a reputable bicycle repair shop with 
        knowledge of the manufacturer's specifications. As a purchaser of bicycle 
        equipment, I assume the full responsibility of carefully assembling my 
        bicycle according to the manufacturer's instructions and specifications, 
        and always checking my bike and related equipment before a ride. I fully 
        understand the hazards involved in the sport of cycling. As in all extreme 
        sports, bodily injury is a possibility at any given time.</p>
      <p align="left">It is incumbent upon me to continuously check my equipment, 
        especially the quick releases and brakes. All quick releases must be checked 
        to make sure they are tight. Failure to do so might lead to failure on 
        the ride. Proper tire inflation is important. Tires need to be checked 
        for tears or worn tread. Allen bolts need to be tight. New bikes should 
        be taken to a professional bike shop to be checked if not assembled by 
        one. Proper lighting equipment and reflectors are very important for personal 
        safety. They should be installed and in place on every ride.</p>
      <p align="left"> By placing my order I explicitly agree to the provisions 
        of the customer agreement and release Bicyclebuys.com from all liability 
        whatsoever except for the shipment of the order I have placed. In no event 
        shall the liability of Bicyclebuys.com be greater than the total amount 
        of my purchase. Additionally, I understand and acknowledge that it is 
        my responsibility to follow the manufacturer's instructions in connection 
        with the assembly of the bicycle and to follow cycling safety guidelines 
        and all local laws regarding cycling and cycling safety. It is recommended 
        that you have a reputable bike shop with knowledge of the manufacturer's 
        specifications perform the assembly. </p>
      <p align="left">Always wear your helmet and proper safety equipment. Bicycle 
        riding can lead to serious accidents. Even with the proper use of safety 
        gear, you could be seriously injured or killed. Bicycle racing, riding, 
        and training can have the same risks as motorcycling, and you assume a 
        large risk with similar speeds and hazards. Fully approved helmets are 
        strongly recommended whenever riding. </font></p>
