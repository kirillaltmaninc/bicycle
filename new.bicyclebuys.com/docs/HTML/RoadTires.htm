Insiders already know it. In 2005 the professional riders of T-Mobile, Saunier Duval, Phonak and Crédit Agricole have chased victories with special tires produced in small production series in Korbach, Germany. They have tested the liquid crystal fibre Vectran® under the hard professional conditions of grit, pot-holes and long hard mileage. Can the phenomenal lab results of the new puncture protection materials predict a phenomenal racing result as well? What do the pros say? Erik Zabel´s opinion is: hot tires. From 2006 the Competition will be equipped with the new Vectran® puncture protection breaker in serial production. One layer of the cut resistant Vectran® under the tread instead of the two layers of nylon used before reduces the weight of the new Competition and improves the rolling comfort and the rolling resistance. The German manufacture of the Competition hasn' t changed. As previously, the world's best pros only trust the handmade production of our seamstress team and our production staff in Korbach.</font></td><td align=right>$99.99</td></tr>

<tr><td>Zipp</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/0603222PART">Zipp Tangente Clincher 700c Tire</a><BR><font size=1>It’s no surprise that more and more riders are seeing the benefits of aero tires. Nor is it a surprise that World Champion triathletes like Andy Potts and Michellie Jones are winning marquee races on the Zipp Tangente Clincher 700c Tires. After all, your tires have the highest airspeed of any part of your bike and the front tire is your machine’s leading edge.
<br> </br>
To cut through the wind, Zipp has used its own patented ABLC dimples to mitigate the "un-aero-ness" of a round shape at the wheel's leading edge. It took Zipp 14 months and 2 trips to the wind tunnel to get it right, and the 21mm version of Tangente saves up to 9 seconds over 40km compared to a traditional “file” tread pattern. No other 23mm tire can touch the Tangente at that width, even when paired with a fully toroidal Zipp rim.
<br> </br>
But the Tangente is not just a delicate special event tire. Thanks to our partnership with Vittoria, the Tangente sports a durable yet supple 290tpi casing. Because the dimpled pattern resists cracking so well, we were able to use an exclusive extra-light rubber compound for lower rolling resistance and higher cornering grip in wet and dry conditions.</font></td><td align=right>$74.99</td></tr>
