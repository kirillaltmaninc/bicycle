<tr><td>Zipp</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/1630618PART">Zipp Service Course Handlebar</a><BR><font size=1>When it comes to handlebars, tried and true aluminum remains the material of choice for many pros. In part, that’s because their bikes have to meet a minimum weight requirement, so there’s little reason to use a sub-200g carbon fiber bar like the Zipp SL. But it also means that aluminum bars like the Service Course have to provide a level of fit, durability, and performance that rivals what can be achieved in carbon.
<br> </br>
The Service Course is produced using 7050 aluminum for impressive strength and rigidity at a weight of 280g (42cm). It features a classic look with round cross-sections throughout and is available in the same Short & Shallow or Traditional Bend shapes as our carbon bars.

But it also means that aluminum bars like the Service Course SL have to meet the fit, durability, and performance standards of athletes like US cyclocross champion Tim Johnson and the Cannondale Cyclocross Team prepared by CyclocrossWorld.
<br> </br>
The Zipp Service Course SL Handlebar is produced using our proprietary ZTL-71 alloy and intricate internal butting processes to achieve a weight of 260g (42cm) with superior strength and rigidity.

It weighs a mere 170g (SS drops, 42cm o-o), but it's stiff enough to grunt over the steepest grades and smooth enough for all-day comfort, thanks to Zipp's VCLC vibration-damping technology included in all Zipp's bars. Features like dual cable routing grooves and a gradual taper from 31.8mm at the clamp to 24.2mm at the bends contribute to the SL's classic looks.
<br> </br>
Zipp's goal was to design the lightest drop bar available while still passing EFBe Laboratory's top performance racing standard. Zipp has achieved it with the SL.</font></td><td align=right>$349.95</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zipp</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/1630615PART">Zipp SLC2 Carbon Handlebar</a><BR><font size=1>The Zipp SLC2 Carbon Handlebar satisfies even the most demanding riders with a massively stiff handlebar that's clip-on compatible and weighs just 190g (SS drops, 42cm o-o). To get there, we started out by keeping more than 60% of the bar width at the same 31.8mm diameter as the clamp area. Then we strategically redesigned the carbon laminate structure, adding strength around the clamp to handle clip-on extensions and stiffness to handle sprinting loads.
<br> </br>
Despite its stout characteristics, the SLC2 cuts no corners in terms of ride quality due to Zipp's vibration absorbing VCLC technology. The only Zipp drop bar designed for clip-on extensions, the SLC2 is the perfect complement to the VukaClip with your choice of VukaExtensions.</font></td><td align=right>$249.99</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zipp</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/1610086PART">Zipp Vuka Aero w/ Vuka Shift Extension</a><BR><font size=1>In the constant struggle against your physical and mental limits, you need to find the ideal setup for the most important piece of equipment: you. But the fastest position that balances aerodynamics, power output, and comfort can be elusive. That’s why Zipp created the VukaAero. It’s a full-carbon integrated aerobar that optimizes the aerodynamics of the bar itself while allowing the widest possible range of adjustment.
<br> </br>
To fine-tune your fit, the VukaAero is the only integrated aero bar that allows 4 axes of adjustment of the extensions: fore-aft, vertical, rotational, and angular. The armrests can be spaced at 3 standard widths or a multitude of positions with the optional wings. Integrated full-carbon brake levers mimic the position, shape, and even the grippy texture of standard brake hoods.
<br> </br>
The Vuka Aero Bar with Vuka Shift Extenstion does away entirely with the drag-inducing clamps and bolts that protrude from other fully adjustable aero bars. Internal compression sleeves secure each extension with a single hollow bolt that’s also the point of exit for the internally routed shifter cable. The VukaAero’s base bar can be rotated /- 2.5 degrees without a noticeable affect on aerodynamics.
<br> </br>
It measures 42cm (o-o), weighs 750 grams (without extensions), and is available with any of our 3 standard Vuka extensions or VukaShift R2C extensions. (available in 3 versions to fit R2C, SRAM and Shimano shifters). Not compatible with Shimano Dura-Ace 7900 brake calipers.</font></td><td align=right>$1049.99</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zipp</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/1610088">Zipp Vuka Clip Set</a><BR><font size=1>Most aero extensions are built around the tradeoff between clean lines and adjustability. Not so with the Zipp Vuka Clip Set, which gives you an incredible range of fine-tuning but only the most stripped-down frontal area.
<br> </br>
Using the VukaAero’s compression sleeve system without any external clamps or bolts, the VukaClip allows 4 axes of adjustment to the extensions: fore-aft, vertical, rotational, and angular. The replaceable EVA foam pads are supported either directly above or 12.5mm behind the base bar and may be rotated to give 42 possible positional combinations for maximum comfort and control.
<br> </br>
This unique clip-on aero bar is designed with internal cable routing for Zipp’s chicane, straight, ski tip or VukaShift (chicane) extensions, which may be cut up to 90mm to give an overall length adjustment of nearly 120mm. Weight is 390g for VukaClip and approximately 100g for extensions (available separately).
<br> </br>
The precision-machined aluminum body is shot-peened for added fatigue strength. All parts are coated with our special anodizing process to eliminate any sweat corrosion.
<br> </br>
VukaClip is sized for 31.8mm bars like Zipp’s VukaBull and SLC2, and includes precision machined spacers for 26.0mm bars. The VukaClip does not include aero extensions. Your choice of chicane, straight, ski tip or VukaShift (chicane) are available individually.</font></td><td align=right>$174.99</td></tr>

Straight extensions will get you as low as humanly possible. Chicanes are ideal for mid-range speed and share their S-bend shape with the VukaShift. Ski Tips offer long-haul comfort.

All Vuka extensions can be shortened by almost 100mm from their standard 335mm length to accommodate any bike configuration including ITU-legal racing. Internal cable routing for aerodynamics and ergonomics. Approximately 100g per pair.</font></td><td align=right>$129.99</td></tr>

That’s the simple idea behind the Vuka Shift Extension Bars.
<br> </br>
This designs saves up to 80 grams by eliminating the use of expansion bolts inside the extensions. By moving the shift levers 30mm closer to your hands, the VukaShift eases wrist strain and keeps your hands in the fastest aero position as you shift into the 11.
