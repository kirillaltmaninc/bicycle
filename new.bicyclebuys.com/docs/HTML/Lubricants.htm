<tr><td>AMF</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/1700889">AMF Rust Eraser</a><BR><font size=1>AMF Rust Eraser. This stuff is the most magical creation of all time. Rust eraser leaves a new bright satin finish on all metal surfaces (bicycle, auto, truck, etc). Also cleans and removes scuffs, heel marks, stains, and discolorations from tile, plastics, fiberclass, ceramics, wood, brick, stone, whitewall tires, etc. There is no quicker easier or neater way to restore stained or discolored surfaces. How to Use: Rub against rusted or corroded metals. No preparation of any kind required and it leaves no mess. Note: on some highly polished metals like chrome some dulling might result as it leaves a brushed satin appearance.</font></td><td align=right>$7.99</td></tr>

Develeoped with the Boeing Aircraft Corporation,  Boeshield T-9 Waterproof Lubricant will dissolve itself and flush out any other lubricant. Penetrates deeply to thoroughly coat inner pins and rollers.  Dries to a clean Paraffin Wax film so it will not pick up dirt.  Lubricates and protects for 150 to 200 miles per application.</font></td><td align=right>$4.99</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chain-L</td><td><a href="http://www.bicyclebuys.com/item/1736510">Chain-L Chain Oil 4 oz</a><BR><font size=1>Chain-L satisfies what we think are the three most important requirements of a chain lubricant: Lubrication, Lubrication, and Lubrication. While properties like external cleanliness may seem important, the fact is that internal wear of the 112 overloaded, overworked and overlooked
bearings is what destroys chains. A road cyclist, riding first-tier equipment, will typically wear a chain out in as little as 50* hours of use -- often
destroying the cassette or chainrings in the process. On a high-end bike, drivetrain wear is the most expensive maintenance cost per mile.
That’s why, when developing Chain-L, the inventors approached it as a bearing-
wear problem and formulated it consistent with the theory of how chains wear and how best to combat it. After road testing the product with racers, messengers, shop staff and others, it has been refined over the span of
almost a year prior to introduction on the market. Since 2007 it has been suprising road, tri, mountain, and commutter cyclist with its longevity, cleanliness, and smooth shifting.</font></td><td align=right>$10.99</td></tr>

As 1-Step loosens and removes surface grime, it delivers a clean low friction film of lubricant. 1-Step Cleaner & Lubricant prevents premature component wear while reducing pedaling friction and drive-train noise.  1-Step is also formulated to provide maximum rust protection. 1-Step is an extremely effective performance-enhancing bicycle maintenance product.</font></td><td align=right>$6.99</td></tr>

Guaranteed to optimize the performance and efficiency of bottom brackets, hubs and headset bearings. As bearings become coated with Teflon and ceramic particles, friction and heat is dissipated. Bearings last longer and run quieter and smoother. Prevents rusting even when exposed to salt water. Excellent on stems & posts as well as cables and threaded assemblies.</font></td><td align=right>$7.99</td></tr>

An “extreme” lube; super durable high viscosity synthetic oils, special polymers, anti-wear additives, friction modifiers, and more, all combine to make this Finish Line’s strongest, longest lasting, most water resistant lubricant. WET Lube goes on wet and stays wet on the chain. Recommended for long-distance riding and extreme weather conditions. If you use WET Lube for riding off-road or in dry climates, be sure to wipe the excess from parts; this will help minimize the attraction of dirt and grime. Since 1994, when this lube was first introduced, it has become the preferred lubricant for many professional on and off-road teams world-wide. Use WET Lube when you ride hard and long. Proven performance for 100-plus mile rides, muddy off-road conditions, long rainy commutes, and foggy salt-air coastal climates. A heavier, wet-style lubricant that requires a little more attention to drivetrain cleanliness, but delivers the ultimate in lubricity and protection.</font></td><td align=right>$3.99</td></tr>
